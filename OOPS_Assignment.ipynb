        "Constructor: It is automatically called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the object's attributes and sets up the initial state of the object.\n",
        "Regular Method: Regular methods must be called explicitly using the object they belong to. They are invoked when a specific action or operation needs to be performed on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Return Value:\n",
        "Constructor: It doesn't return anything explicitly. The __init__ method is responsible for initializing the object, and the created object is automatically returned.\n",
        "Regular Method: Regular methods can return values as per the logic implemented\n",

        "Usage:\n",
        "Constructor: Used to set up the initial state of the object, typically initializing attributes.\n",
        "Regular Method: Used to perform specific actions on the object, such as modifying attributes, computing values, or executing some functionality.\n",
        "Regular Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "Declaration:\n",
        "Constructor: Declared using the def __init__(self, ...): syntax.\n",
        "Regular Method: Declared using the def keyword with any name of the developer's choice.\n",

        "Access to Attributes:\n",

        "\n",
        "Modularity:\n",
        "Encapsulation promotes modularity by organizing code into self-contained units (classes). Each class encapsulates its data and behavior, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
        "Changes to one class do not necessarily affect other parts of the program, enhancing code modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Isolation:\n",
        "Attributes of a class are typically declared as private or protected, restricting direct access from outside the class. This isolation helps prevent unintended interference with the internal state of an object.\n",
        "The internal implementation details of a class are hidden, allowing for changes to be made within the class without affecting the rest of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Information Hiding:\n",
        "Encapsulation supports the concept of information hiding, where the internal details of a class are hidden from external entities. Only the essential interface (public methods) is exposed.\n",
        "This reduces complexity for users of the class, as they only need to understand and interact with the public interface, leading to simpler and more maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enhanced Code Maintainability:\n",
        "Encapsulation improves code maintainability by localizing changes. Modifications to the internal implementation of a class are limited to that class, reducing the likelihood of unintended consequences elsewhere in the codebase.\n",
        "This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs, add new features, or refactor code without affecting the entire system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Security:\n",
        "Encapsulation contributes to security by restricting direct access to sensitive data and internal implementation details. Private and protected attributes prevent external code from directly manipulating the internal state of an object.\n",
        "Controlled access through public methods allows for validation and ensures that operations on the data follow specified rules, reducing the risk of unintended side effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Versioning and Compatibility:\n",
        "Encapsulation facilitates versioning and maintaining backward compatibility. Changes made to the internal implementation of a class can be managed within the class, allowing for a smoother transition between different versions of the software.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility and Adaptability:\n",
        "Encapsulation allows for the creation of well-defined interfaces, making it easier to adapt and extend a system. Users of a class can interact with its public interface without being concerned about the internal details, promoting flexibility in the overall design."

This lack of strict enforcement can lead to unintentional access and modification of supposedly private or protected attributes.\n",

        "Composition encourages encapsulation by allowing objects to hide their internal details. Each component is responsible for its own functionality and exposes a well-defined interface to the outside world. This encapsulation reduces the impact of changes within a component on other parts of the system, making it easier to maintain.\n",
        "Modularity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition supports a modular design, where the system is divided into smaller, independently replaceable components. These components, often represented by classes, can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. This modularity simplifies the codebase, making it more understandable and allowing developers to focus on individual components without the need to comprehend the entire system at once.\n",
        "Code Reusability:\n",
        "\n",
        "With composition, individual components can be reused in different contexts. By creating small, reusable classes, developers can leverage existing components to build new functionalities. This not only reduces redundancy but also promotes a more efficient use of code, leading to a more maintainable codebase.\n",
        "Flexibility and Adaptability:\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition provides flexibility in modifying or extending a system without affecting its overall structure. New components can be added, existing components can be replaced, and the interactions between components can be adjusted. This adaptability is crucial for systems that need to evolve over time to meet changing requirements.\n",
        "Reduced Coupling:\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition helps reduce coupling between components. Each component interacts with others through well-defined interfaces, and changes to one component are less likely to affect others. This loose coupling makes the system more maintainable, as modifications to one part are less likely to have ripple effects throughout the entire codebase.\n",
        "Clear Responsibilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition promotes a clear assignment of responsibilities to individual components. Each class or module has a specific purpose, making it easier to understand the code's structure and design. This clarity facilitates maintenance tasks such as bug fixing, adding new features, or making improvements.\n",
        "Testing:\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition supports modular testing, allowing for the independent testing of components. Unit tests can be written for individual classes, ensuring that each component behaves as expected. This granularity in testing simplifies the identification and resolution of issues, contributing to the overall maintainability of the system.\n",
        "Ease of Debugging:\n",
        "\n",
        "When issues arise, the modular nature of composition makes debugging more straightforward. Developers can focus on the specific component or module where the problem occurs, rather than having to navigate through a monolithic codebase. This targeted debugging process speeds up issue resolution and maintenance."
